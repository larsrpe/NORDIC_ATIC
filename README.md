# Requirements
To run this you will need pytorch,numpy and scipy.

# Demonstration
Running main.py will reproduce the results from the paper. To be able to run the walking man example you will need to download the mp4 video from here: and place it at:
```
videos
└── man_walking.mp4

Note that he required interpolation is time consuming and not entirely stable. For convinience you can download the precomputed interpolation coeffs from here: and place the file at:

```
data
└── walking_man
    └── resolution64.pt

      
    
```
mkdir models

        └── faster_rcnn_1_8_132028.pth
```
